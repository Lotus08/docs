## Getting Started

1. Make sure XCode, Homebrew, and Git are installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the parent directory (folder) you want to place your code in.
3. In terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magicbell-io/docs.git
```

4. Then, run:  

```bash
yarn install
```

5. You should be all set up now to see MagicBell docs on your local machine. To spin up your development server, run:

shortDescription: HMAC provides digital signatures using symmetric keys

In cryptography, an HMAC (sometimes expanded as either keyed-hash
message authentication code or hash-based message authentication code) is a
specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic
hash function and a secret cryptographic key. As with any MAC, it may be used
to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a
message.

Here is the definition from [Wikipedia's article on HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).

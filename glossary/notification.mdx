Notifications come in many shapes and forms, and we love that!
What you may call a notification, your co-worker may call an update, while some
others may think of it as an activity. In our view, all of the following are
notifications:

- A lead responded to your offer.
- Your friend tagged you in a comment.
- Your account balance just went negative.
- We just released a new feature!

On a more philosophical level, a notification is a pointer to something
important. It could be a pointer to an update your users need to pay attention
to or an item they need to work on. You can send a notification to one user or
to a group of user. For example, as a SaaS software provider, you'd want to
send billing related notifications to all the users from an organization.

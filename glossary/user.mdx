Users are people that you send notifications to. They are
your customers - the users of your product. MagicBell bills you based on the
number of monthly active users (MAU).

Users can be identified by their email address or any other ID coming from your
system (we call it `external_id`). We talk about this in the Authentication
guide and help you pick the identifier that fits your use-case best.

## Channel Overrides

`overrides` is an optional attribute you can set when you [create a notification](/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification).
It is used to change a specific channel's title, content, and action url when
that content should differ from other channels.

Below illustrates how to make the subject of an email different from the title
of other notifications.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
      }
    ],
    "overrides": {
      "channels": {
        "email": {
          "title": "New title of email"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The keys accepted are:

- `in_app.title`
- `in_app.content`
- `in_app.action_url`
- `email.title`
- `email.content`
- `email.action_url`
- `web_push.title`
- `web_push.content`
- `web_push.action_url`
- `mobile_push.title`
- `mobile_push.content`
- `mobile_push.action_url`

## Provider Overrides

If you have a custom email provider configured for your account, you can use
`overrides` to send payoad specific to
[Postmark](https://magicbell.com/docs/email/postmark),
[SendGrid](https://magicbell.com/docs/email/sendgrid), or
[Mailgun](https://magicbell.com/docs/email/mailgun).

The data is sent to the email provider's API. MagicBell does not validate or
transform this data. Please refer to your provider's API reference, here you
have links to some of the providers we integrate with:

- [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api)
- [SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send)
- [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html#sending)

For example, you can add cc and bcc recipients for Postmark sending this payload
to the create notifications endpoint:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
      }
    ],
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "postmark": {
          "Cc": "dan@magicbell.com",
          "Bcc": "hana@magicbell.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

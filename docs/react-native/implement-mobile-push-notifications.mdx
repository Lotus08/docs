MagicBell can help you implement mobile push notifications in three steps.

## Setup iOS push notifications

To deliver push notifications from your iOS app you need to register a new auth key
for the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) and send it to us. MagicBell will use p8
tokens to authenticate requests made to the APNs.

Follow these steps to register a new key:

- Login to [your Apple developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account) and open the keys page. You will need to be registered as an
- Register a new key, make sure you enable "Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)"
- Apple will generate a 10-digit ID and an authentication token signing key. Store it safely.

MagicBell needs the p8 key, its ID, the team ID for your Apple account, and your iOS app's bundle ID. Please [contact us](mailto:hello@magicbell.io) so we can help you set them up for your account.

## Setup Android push notifications

To deliver push notifications from your Android app you need to create a Firebase
project and set your [Firebase credentials](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server) for MagicBell.
Follow these steps to do it:

- Login to your [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com), pick your project and open the settings page of that project. If you don't have a project yet, create one.
- Open the Cloud Messaging settings tab, copy the server key and sender ID.

MagicBell needs the project's server key, sender ID, and the bundle ID of your Android app. Please [get in touch with us](mailto:hello@magicbell.io) so we can help you set them up for your account.

## Configure your mobile app

Once your credentials are set, MagicBell will deliver mobile push notifications
when you create notifications through [the create notifications API endpoint](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification).
However, you still need to configure your app.

If you are developing your app with [Expo](https://expo.io) or any other [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) library we recommend using
[this React Native library](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification). Here you have a short example:

```jsx title=React-Native
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Alert, View, Text } from 'react-native';

export default class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    PushNotification.createChannel({
      channelId: 'default-channel-id',
      channelName: 'Default channel',
      soundName: 'default',
      vibrate: true,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>welcome to MagicBell</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

PushNotification.configure({
  onNotification: (notification) => {
    Alert.alert(notification.title, notification.message);
  },
  requestPermissions: true,
});
```

If you face any issues while configuring the library, please feel free to shoot us a note, we will be happy to help.
You might also find it helpful to read the [full React Native example](https://github.com/magicbell-io/react-native-notifications-example) we created.

This is a sample payload MagicBell will push to your app:

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "id": "7fb3ce9f-a866-4dff-8ce8-2f64f7c5ed4c",
    "title": "Pickup Instructions â€“ In-Store",
    "action_url": "https://magicbell.com/pricing",
    "content": "<ul><li>Bring your valid government-issued photo ID.</li></ul>",
    "category": "order_ready",
    "custom_attributes": {
      "order_number": "W846MD",
      "part_number": "MRJL74/C"
    }
  }
}
```

If you set [overrides](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification) for the `mobile_push` channel, those values will be pushed to your app.

### UI

At [app.magicbell.com/projects](https://app.magicbell.com/projects) you can change colors, typography, and additional styling. You must then copy the code in 'Notification Inbox Code' and paste the updated code in your application.

### JavaScript

The UI can be bypassed, and styling can be directly changed in the JavaScript snippet.

### ReactSDK

Our team built a ReactSDK to give more power to you! An example is the ability to completely customize the in-app notification inbox to match the design of your product. See our [ReactSDK documentation](https://magicbell.com/docs/react/theme-customization) and the [React package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react) to learn more!

## Vision Going Forward
Our goal is for customers to have a notification system as fast as possible - in under 30 mins - and continue to wow day after day. We vow to continue to make MagicBell a more powerful tool without compromising ease of use.

Building a notification system in-house is hard! There's a lot of complexity and a wide breadth of features needed: the in-app experience, multiple channels (email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, branding, and more. 

MagicBell takes care of all the work, so you never have to think about notifications again! ðŸ™‚

MY Note

i really like the idea of putting in magicbell notifications as main headers, or to break up the page:

Welcome to [MagicBell - the notification inbox](https://magicbell.com) for your product. We
want to thank you for using MagicBell or considering it. We understand that using MagicBell
is an important decision with long-term consequences for your team and your users. Therefore,
let us start this relationship by explaining our product vision and philosophy to you.

## Product Vision

Our core philosophy in designing MagicBell is to help you get started fast and then offer more power under the hood when you are ready for it. We promise to make MagicBell more powerful each day but without compromising the ease of getting started.

When building a notification system in-house, there is a lot to worry about - in-app experience, multiple channels (email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, and branding. MagicBell offers you a lot of this in a well-packaged experience that works well for both you and your end-user.

Our long-term goal is to take everything related to notifications off your plate and help you focus on achieving your goals, not on your notification system. As you work with MagicBell, we'd love to hear your feedback and ideas on how we can make this happen.

## Using these docs

In the following pages, we'll get you familiarized with the core concepts in MagicBell and help you decide how you'd like to implement MagicBell in your product. For example, you may want to use our notification inbox (highly recommended if you are just getting started) or build a completely custom UI (it's not that as hard as it sounds). Hit us up if you'd like a more concierge experience - we are always happy to help our customers over a zoom call.

title: Ping Email Provider
subtitle: Leverage MagicBell's smart functionality while retaining complete control over emails.
---

If you prefer to set up email in your codebase to have full control when rendering emails, 'Ping' is probably for you!

'Ping' allows you to receive a webhook when MagicBell recommends sending an email based on [MagicBell's smart functionality](https://magicbell.com/docs/smart-notifications). You're getting the benefits of MagicBell, yet have complete control over every email.

## Setup

If you'd like to use ping, please contact us and send over your project ID, and the URL. This configuration will be available in the dashboard very soon.

## Payload

The payload you receive in the webhook follows a format similar to the response from our [GET /notifications/{id}](/docs/rest-api/reference#get-notification) endpoint.

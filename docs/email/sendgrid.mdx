## Deliver email notifications with your SendGrid account

To configure SendGrid for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

- Sign up for SendGrid and obtain an API key. It must have full access to the Mail Send endpoint.
- Send us your API key and your verified sender identity (email address).
- Verify the emails channel in MagicBell is enabled

Once your account is set up, MagicBell will automatically deliver email
notifications through your SendGrid account, **no additional work is needed**. You will
be able to use SendGrid's [activity feed](https://app.sendgrid.com/email_activity)
to view your activity.

## Sending emails with additional or unique content

Our create notification endpoint allows you to customize the content sent to
SendGrid by setting [`overrides`](/docs/overrides).

The `overrides` parameter accepts all of the [SendGrid's Web API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send)
parameters.

Below you can see how to send an email notification with custom headers.

```json
"notification": {
  "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
  "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
  "recipients": [{
    "email": "dan@example.com"
  }],
  "overrides": {
    "providers": {
      "sendgrid": {
        "headers": {
          "X-Original-To": "team@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Using SendGrid email templates

MagicBell can deliver email notifications using your SendGrid email templates.
To do it create a template in SendGrid, and its ID.

Then set the `template_id` attribute in `overrides` when creating a
notification. MagicBell will use `custom_attributes` to fill in your template.

```json
"notification": {
  "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
  "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
  "recipients": [{
    "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
  }],
  "custom_attributes": {
    "name": "Dan",
    "company": {
      "name": "Example Inc"
    }
  }
  "overrides": {
    "providers": {
      "sendgrid": {
        "template_id": "[sengrid_template_id]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

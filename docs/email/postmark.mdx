subtitle: How to use Postmark with MagicBell
---

## Deliver email notifications with your Postmark account

To configure Postmark for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

- Sign up for Postmark and obtain a server API token
- Verify your sender signature in Postmark
- Send us your **server ID token** and **verified sender signature** (email address)
- Verify the emails channel in MagicBell is enabled

Once your account is set up, MagicBell will automatically deliver email
notifications through your Postmark account, **no additional work is needed**.

Please keep in mind that MagicBell automatically injects both `notification_id`
and `broadcast_id` in the metadata of messages sent to Postmark.

## Sending emails with additional or unique content

Our create notification endpoint allows you to customize the content sent to
SendGrid by setting [`overrides`](/docs/overrides).

The `overrides` parameter accepts all of the body parameters of
[Postmark's Email API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api).

Below is an example of a tagged message with custom headers.

```json
"notification": {
  "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
  "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
  "category": "new_message",
  "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
  "recipients": [{
    "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
  }],
  "overrides": {
    "providers": {
      "postmark": {
        "Tag": "onboarding",
        "Headers": {
            "X-Original-To": "team@example.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

title: Getting started with MagicBell
---

This section will walk you through sending notifications to your users and retrieving notifications sent to a user. You can explore all available API endpoints [here](/docs/rest-api/reference).

Before you start, you need a MagicBell account. If you don't have one already, sign up for MagicBell at [magicbell.com](http://magicbell.com) and obtain your MagicBell project's API key and secret. These keys are available on the Settings page of your MagicBell dashboard.

We encourage you to run examples in your terminal as you read this guide. You will find examples in different programming languages and curl. Use the curl command-line tool to send HTTP requests to your MagicBell. You can install it by running:

```shell
brew install curl
```

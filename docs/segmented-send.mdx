MagicBell allows you to create a notification specifying users by either their
email address or their ID. [Learn more](http://magicbell.com/docs/sending-notifications).

However, you can also specify a group of users to notify. To that end, you can
provide an SQL-like string to the `notification.recipients.matches` parameter.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "We are processing your order",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "matches": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Format

The matches string accepts a wildcard char: `*`, and these logic operators:
`=`, `AND` and `OR`.

With these you form strings that MagicBell can use to search for existing users
either by their email address, external ID or a custom attribute.

These are examples of valid strings that you can pass to the create
notifications API endpoint:

- Notify all users

  ```json hideHeader
  "*"
  ```

- Notify the user whose email is "dan@example.com"

  ```json hideHeader
  "email = dan@example.com"
  ```

- Notify all users whose email starts with "dan"

  ```json hideHeader
  "email = dan@*"
  ```

- Notify all users whose email's domain is "example.com"

  ```json hideHeader
  "email = *@example.com"
  ```

- Notify all users that belong to the "Example" company

  ```json hideHeader
  "custom_attributes.company.name = Example"
  ```

- Notify all users that belong to the "Example" company or their external ID starts with "AB"

  ```json hideHeader
  "custom_attributes.company.name = Example OR external_id = AB*"
  ```

- Notify all users whose external ID ends with "001"

  ```json hideHeader
  "custom_attributes.company.name = *001"
  ```

## Setting custom attributes

In order to take full advantage of this feature, we encourage you to set custom
attributes on your MagicBell users. You can do it using our [users API endpoints](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-user).
